Common Myths About Free Xbox Gift Cards
Myth 1: Gift Card Generators Work

Online searches for free Xbox gift cards often lead to websites promising instant codes through "generators."

Reality: These generators are scams designed to steal personal information or install malware. Xbox gift cards are only issued through authorized sellers and Microsoft.
